// OpenCV has its own cross-OS user interface that allows developers to create their
// own applications without the need to learn complex user interface libraries.

// It is basic but very convenient for native and optimized for real-time use.

// 1. A basic interface based on native user interfaces, cocoa or carbon for Mac OS X, GTK
//		for Linux or Windwos user interfaces, selected by default when compiling OpenCV.
// 2. A slightly more advanced interface based on QT library that is a cross-platform interface.
//		You have to enable the Qt option manually in CMake before compiling OpenCV.
